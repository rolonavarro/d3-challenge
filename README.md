# Data Journalism and D3

* In this repo I use JavaScript and HTML to make a scatter plot using D3.
* I look at the correlation between poverty and healthcare availability in different cities in the US.
* This data is a csv file from U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
* The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

### Instructions
